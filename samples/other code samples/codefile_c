REQ B 50 C 90 D 7   ; requesting resources, this list could go on

DEF $STR_CONTENT "string content"
			; stores to MemorySpace
			; each process has it's own "variable space":
			; [ $STR_NAME : "content" ]


; APP $STR_CONTENT " more" <-- this is wrong, do the following instead:


DEF $APPEND_SUFFIX " more"	; first define, then access
APP $STR_CONTENT $APPEND_SUFFIX ; now $STR_CONTENT will be having the suffix " more"


DEF ^TEXT_FILE_1 	; file variables start with a '^'

MOV $STR_CONTENT ^TEXT_FILE_1
			; stores "string content" into disk


DEF $STR_1 "aaaa"
DEF $STR_2 "a"
